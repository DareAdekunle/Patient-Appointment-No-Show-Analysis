# Patient Appointment No Show Analysis
 
Introduction
In this report I would be looking at a data which reports patient who showed up for their scheduled appointment or not. The data set records the appointment date, scheduled date, gender, patient id, Age, neighbourhood.

The dependent variable, 'No-show' consist of 'yes' or 'No' values corresponding to when a scheduled appointment was missed or when a scheduled appointment was honored respectively.

My research questions are:
<ol>
    <li>Are certain age groups more prone to missing their appointment than others?</li>
    <li>Does gender influence appointments no shows?</li>
    <li>What neighbourhoods has the highest paercentage of no shows?</li>
    <li>On what day of the week are patients most likely to miss their appointment?</li>
</ol>
